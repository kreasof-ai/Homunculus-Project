# Homunculus Project - Experimental Custom Transformer Architecture
By [Habibullah Akbar](https://chavyv.vercel.app).

Key features:
- Seamless integration with vision encoder. Along with selective RoPE for each image and text embedding sequence.
- Internal iteration, making deeper abstraction while keeping the same parameter count.
- GeGLU activation function, inspired by [Gemma 2 models](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-gemma-2/).
- Custom KV-caching, making sure each internal iteration has an independent KV-cache.
- BPE tokenizer based on KBBI.
- Grouped Query Attention.
- PyTorch Lightning implementation.
- DeepSpeed and ZeRO-3 integration. Automatically offload the memory overflow into CPU and NVMe.
- Finetuning scripts example with LoRA adapters, with and without quantization.
- Add BitNet implementation.
- Flash Attention implementation.
- Speech encoder.
- 2D and 3D RoPE.
- Diffusion Transformer for image detokenization.
- Influential token extraction from attention heatmap.
- Jupyter notebook example, both for training and finetuning.
- Dual license open-source for individuals, paid for commercial uses.

![Internal latent loop (9)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fe74e8b8-2f74-4b20-9f36-6f61c6946f2a)

The iterable Transformer model, where the model can *rethink* its internal cognitive process with an internal confidence score as a guide. Akin of slow thinking mechanism.
So this is the simple explanation of how it works:
- We put an adjustable parameter to handle internal looping, the default value is 1.
- If the loss value is high, this iteration is triggered, with max iterations set to 10.
- We train an independent layer to output a confidence score, trained by loss value from the main training process.
- When inference, both the next token and confidence scores are outputted and can determine how many iterations are needed for the current inference.
